        <p>My name is Qazi Islam. My obsession started when I was 13 and I hijacked my brothers DSLR. That day I found a new form of communication. Photography to me is the most organic form of communication;it’s the way I speak. The human connection is what I seek to capture while creating reference points in this great story of life for people. Being a creative starts by listening to your inner voice;if you can’t listen then you can’t speak. I hope you hear what I’m talking about and maybe someday we can speak.</p>
